    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Rasam is a comforting South Indian soup known for its bold, tangy, and spicy flavors. Made with tamarind, tomatoes, and a fragrant blend of spices like black pepper, cumin, and mustard seeds, rasam is both soothing and invigorating. It’s often enjoyed with steamed rice or sipped on its own as a light, warming soup. Whether served as part of a traditional South Indian meal or as a simple home remedy for colds, rasam is the perfect balance of flavor and comfort.</p>
